# gitfetch
zshrc configuration file that allows displaying gifs as fastfetch logo in kitty
I don't really have the time nor the motivation to explain this shit, just read the code and create an issue if you have any questions.
The fastfetch function is the only part that you need.
You also need to change the logo source in your fastfetch config

**Requires Kitty Terminal Emulator, bc, and imagemagick installed**
