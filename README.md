# gitfetch
zsh script file that allows displaying gifs as fastfetch logo in kitty
I don't really have the time nor the motivation to explain this shit, just read the code and create an issue if you have any questions.
You also need to change the logo source in your fastfetch config.

**Requires Kitty Terminal Emulator, bc, and imagemagick installed**
Might or might not work in other shells
